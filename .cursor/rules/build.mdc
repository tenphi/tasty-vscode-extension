# Build Workflow

Before building, increment the patch version in `package.json`:

```bash
npm version patch
```

This will automatically increment the patch version (e.g., `2.0.49` → `2.0.50`) and create a git commit.

Then build the VSIX package for testing:

```bash
npm run build:vsix
```

This allows the user to test the extension by installing the generated `.vsix` file in VS Code.
